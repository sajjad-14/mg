# PentestPal

![PentestPal Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=PentestPal)  
*An interactive penetration testing framework for security enthusiasts and professionals.*

PentestPal is a Python-based, command-line penetration testing framework designed to simplify security testing tasks. With a modular architecture, it offers tools for network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and more. Key features like tab-completion, `Ctrl+C` interrupt handling, and detailed reporting make it ideal for both beginners and experienced security professionals.

## Key Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Navigate easily with commands like `use`, `set`, `run`, and `show`.
- **Modular Architecture**: Extend functionality with modules such as `port_scanner`, `xss_scanner`, and more.
- **Port Scanner**: Scan open ports, detect services, and integrate with `nmap` for advanced scans.
- **Tab-Completion**: Autocomplete commands, modules, and options for a seamless experience.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Stop operations gracefully with `Ctrl+C`, displaying a clean result message.
- **Logging**: Track all actions in `pentestpal.log` for auditing and debugging.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with both Linux and Windows.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed.
- **pip**: Python package manager for installing dependencies.
- **nmap** (optional): Required for advanced port scanning features in the `port_scanner` module.

### Steps

#### 1. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt**:
```
termcolor>=2.4.0
python-nmap>=0.7.1
```

#### 2. Install PentestPal
Install the package locally:

```bash
pip install .
```

#### 3. Run PentestPal
Start the interactive console:

```bash
pentestpal
```

## Usage

### Starting the Console
Launch PentestPal to access the interactive console:

```bash
pentestpal
```

A welcome banner will display, followed by the `PentestPal>` prompt.

### Available Commands
| Command              | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `use <module>`       | Select a module (e.g., `use port_scanner`).      |
| `set <option> <value>` | Set module options (e.g., `set target 127.0.0.1`). |
| `run`                | Execute the current module.                     |
| `show modules`       | List all available modules.                     |
| `show options`       | Display options for the current module.         |
| `exit`               | Exit the console.                               |
| `help`               | Show the help menu.                             |

### Example: Port Scanning
1. **Select the Port Scanner Module**:
   ```
   use port_scanner
   ```

2. **Set Options**:
   ```
   set target 127.0.0.1
   set ports 1-1000
   set mode quick
   ```

3. **Run the Scan**:
   ```
   run
   ```

4. **Interrupt the Scan (Optional)**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the scan.
   - Output: `[x] Result: Scan interrupted by user.` (in red).

5. **View Results**:
   - If the scan completes, it will display open ports, services, and a summary.
   - Example output:
     ```
     [+] Result: Scan completed: 2 open, 998 closed, 0 filtered ports
     ```

### Available Modules
- **`port_scanner`**: Scans for open ports, detects services, and supports `nmap` for advanced scans.
- **`xss_scanner`**: Placeholder for XSS vulnerability scanning (to be implemented).
- **`sqli_scanner`**: Placeholder for SQL injection scanning (to be implemented).
- **`csrf_scanner`**: Placeholder for CSRF vulnerability scanning (to be implemented).
- **`ssrf_scanner`**: Placeholder for SSRF vulnerability scanning (to be implemented).
